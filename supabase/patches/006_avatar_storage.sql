-- Patch: storage bucket for member-uploaded avatars.
-- Creates a public 'avatars' bucket and RLS on storage.objects so anyone can
-- read avatars (needed to display them) but a user can only write files under
-- their own user-id folder: avatars/<auth.uid()>/avatar.
-- Run in the Supabase SQL editor. Safe to re-run.

insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public)
values ('avatars', 'avatars', true)
on conflict (id) do nothing;

drop policy if exists "Avatar images are publicly readable" on storage.objects;
create policy "Avatar images are publicly readable"
  on storage.objects for select
  using (bucket_id = 'avatars');

drop policy if exists "Users can upload their own avatar" on storage.objects;
create policy "Users can upload their own avatar"
  on storage.objects for insert to authenticated
  with check (bucket_id = 'avatars' and (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text);

drop policy if exists "Users can update their own avatar" on storage.objects;
create policy "Users can update their own avatar"
  on storage.objects for update to authenticated
  using (bucket_id = 'avatars' and (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text);
